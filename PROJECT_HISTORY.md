# StrataBox Project History

## Development Process with Cursor AI

1. **Initial Request**: Create a CircuitPython project for a Raspberry Pi Pico that emulates a USB keyboard for Helldivers using arcade buttons.

2. **Core Implementation**:
   - Created basic keyboard emulation with button-to-key mapping
   - Set up wiring and configuration for 5 Sanwa arcade buttons
   - Implemented debouncing and LED feedback

3. **Configuration and Documentation**:
   - Added detailed README, INSTALL, and WIRING guides
   - Created a customizable config.py for button mappings
   - Implemented a button test utility

4. **Advanced Features vs Simplification**:
   - Initially created pre-recorded stratagem sequences (macros)
   - Removed macros in favor of manual input for authentic gameplay
   - Discussed but didn't implement a "practice mode" using LED patterns

5. **Device Identification**:
   - Added custom USB device name to identify as "StrataBox Controller"
   - Implemented auto-test sequence on connection
   - Created visual LED patterns for status indication

6. **Debug Utilities**:
   - Added Raspberry Pi Debug Probe support
   - Created utilities for timing analysis, USB testing
   - Implemented comprehensive debug reporting

This project transformed a Raspberry Pi Pico into a tactile arcade-style controller for Helldivers 2, focusing on preserving the fun of manual stratagem input while providing a more satisfying physical interface.
